## Architecture Notes

### Custom Client
- Acts as a container for RSDK and Sonic 3 AIR
- Manages transitions and state
- No direct communication between RSDK and Sonic 3 AIR
- All communication goes through the Custom Client

### RSDK Integration
- Uses RSDKv4 for Sonic 1 and 2
- RSDKv3 compatibility layer for Sonic CD
- Handles Data.rsdk files

### Sonic 3 AIR Integration
- Hybrid approach:
  * 1/3 emulation
  * 1/3 native engine
  * 1/3 Lemonscript (C++ sub-language)
- Uses original Genesis ROM
- Treats ROM similar to Data.rsdk files
