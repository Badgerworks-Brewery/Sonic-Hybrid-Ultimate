# Sonic Hybrid Ultimate

Aims to mix different Sonic the Hedgehog games into a single big game. Acts as a legal but cheaper version of Sonic Origins for fans that dont want to get scammed.

## How it's gonna work.
Instead of mixing 3 AIR'S Engine (called Oxygen) with the RSDK/Retro engine or compiling rsdk and 3 air as seperate EXEs to be laucnhed in one window, both of which is what this project gets confused as being, the project will have 3 (main) working parts:

Sonic 3 AIR/Oxygen Engine.

Sonic Hybrid RSDK plus the Decompilations of RSDK Versions 3, 4 and/or 5U

And a seperate Frontend for managing both.

The Frontend will oversee and run both parts seperately, after Sonic 2 ends, the Frontend begins launching Sonic 3 and Knuckles via Sonic 3 AIR, sort of like switching HDMI inputs from one device to another on a TV.

## Completion Status:
Hybrid-RSDK Debugging/Additons ?% (Hybrid-RSDK is still broken)

Sonic 3 AIR (Oxygen) Integration 50% (All the source code is in the repo, but we havent done the neccessary changes yet)
Integration with Hybrid RSDK is in progress, focusing on resolving loading issues and graphical corruption.

Custom Client 0% (debugging Hybrid RSDK is the priority)

## Build Process

### Prerequisites
- CMake 3.15 or higher
- C++17 compatible compiler
- .NET 6.0 SDK
- Git with submodule support

### Dependencies (Linux/Ubuntu)
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y cmake build-essential pkg-config libsdl2-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglew-dev libvorbis-dev libtinyxml2-dev
```

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository with submodules:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Badgerworks-Brewery/Sonic-Hybrid-Ultimate.git
cd Sonic-Hybrid-Ultimate
```

2. Fetch RSDK decompilations:
```bash
chmod +x fetch_rsdkv3.sh fetch_rsdkv4.sh fetch_rsdkv5.sh
./fetch_rsdkv4.sh
./fetch_rsdkv3.sh
./fetch_rsdkv5.sh
```

3. Build the Hybrid RSDK engine:
```bash
cd "Hybrid-RSDK Main"
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
cd ../..
```

4. Build the Custom Client:
```bash
cd "Custom Client"
dotnet build
cd ..
```

5. Put the required game data files in `Hybrid-RSDK Main/rsdk-source-data/`:
   - `Data.rsdk` from Sonic CD as `soniccd.rsdk`
   - `Data.rsdk` from Sonic 1 as `sonic1.rsdk`
   - `Data.rsdk` from Sonic 2 as `sonic2.rsdk`
   - `Rom.bin` from Sonic 3&K as `sonic3.bin`

6. Run the executable and have fun!

## Perform an update

This guide is useful if you previously played Sonic Hybrid but you want to perform an update. Please look at the [commit list](https://github.com/Badgerworks-Brewery/Sonic-Hybrid-Ultimate/commits/main) to know more info about the changelog through each update.

1. Pull the latest changes:
```bash
git pull --recurse-submodules
```

2. Update RSDK decompilations:
```bash
./fetch_rsdkv4.sh
./fetch_rsdkv3.sh
./fetch_rsdkv5.sh
```

3. Rebuild the project following steps 3-4 from the build instructions above.

## Features

## Resources

Xeeynamo has written [some notes](rsdkv3-to-rsdkv4.md) on how to convert RSDKv3 scripts to RSDKv4 scripts without modifying the RSDKv4 engine.

Everything contained in `rsdk/Scripts` is a modified version of [Rubberduckycooly's Sonic 1/2 script decompilation](https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/Sonic-1-Sonic-2-2013-Script-Decompilation). This project would not exist without it.

The function `SonicHybridRsdk.Unpack12/DecryptData` was written by Giuseppe Gatta (nextvolume) from its [Retrun](http://unhaut.epizy.com/retrun/).
